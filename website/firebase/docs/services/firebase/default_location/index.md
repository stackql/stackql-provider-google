Creates, updates, deletes, gets or lists a <code>default_location</code> resource.

## Overview
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><code>default_location</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="firebase.firebase.default_location" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields

The following fields are returned by `SELECT` queries:

`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource.


## Methods

The following methods are available for this resource:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Accessible by</th>
    <th>Required Params</th>
    <th>Optional Params</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#finalize"><CopyableCode code="finalize" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="exec" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-projectsId"><code>projectsId</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>**DECOMMISSIONED.** **If called, this endpoint will return a 404 error.** _Instead, use the applicable resource-specific REST API to set the location for each resource used in your Project._ Sets the ["location for default Google Cloud resources"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#default-cloud-location) for the specified FirebaseProject. This method creates a Google App Engine application with a [default Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/setting-up-cloud-storage#activating_a_cloud_storage_bucket), located in the specified [`locationId`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/projects.defaultLocation/finalize). This location must be one of the available [App Engine locations](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#region). After the location for default Google Cloud resources is finalized, or if it was already set, it cannot be changed. The location for default Google Cloud resources for the specified `FirebaseProject` might already be set because either the underlying Google Cloud `Project` already has an App Engine application or `FinalizeDefaultLocation` was previously called with a specified `locationId`. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/operations), which can be used to track the provisioning process. The [`response`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) type of the `Operation` is google.protobuf.Empty. The `Operation` can be polled by its `name` using GetOperation until `done` is true. When `done` is true, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` has succeeded, its [`response`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) will be set to a google.protobuf.Empty; if the `Operation` has failed, its `error` will be set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. All fields listed in the [request body](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/firebase-management/rest/v1beta1/projects.defaultLocation/finalize) are required. To call `FinalizeDefaultLocation`, a member must be an Owner of the Project.</td>

## Parameters

Parameters can be passed in the `WHERE` clause of a query. Check the [Methods](#methods) section to see which parameters are required or optional for each operation.
