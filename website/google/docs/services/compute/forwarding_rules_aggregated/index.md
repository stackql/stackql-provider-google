Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.

    <td><CopyableCode code="IPAddress" /></td>
    <td><code>string</code></td>
    <td>IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address number.</td>

Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate traffic to backend buckets attached to this forwarding rule by percentage using externalManagedBackendBucketMigrationTestingPercentage. Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.</td>
