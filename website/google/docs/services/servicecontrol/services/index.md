## Overview
<table><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Name</b></td><td><code>services</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Type</b></td><td>Resource</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Id</b></td><td><CopyableCode code="google.servicecontrol.services" /></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Fields

The following fields are returned by `SELECT` queries:

`SELECT` not supported for this resource, use `SHOW METHODS` to view available operations for the resource.


## Methods

The following methods are available for this resource:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Accessible by</th>
    <th>Required Params</th>
    <th>Optional Params</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#check"><CopyableCode code="check" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="exec" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-serviceName"><code>serviceName</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>This method provides admission control for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It checks whether an operation should be allowed based on the service configuration and relevant policies. It must be called before the operation is executed. For more information, see [Admission Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/admission-control). NOTE: The admission control has an expected policy propagation delay of 60s. The caller **must** not depend on the most recent policy changes. NOTE: The admission control has a hard limit of 1 referenced resources per call. If an operation refers to more than 1 resources, the caller must call the Check method multiple times. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.check` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><a href="#report"><CopyableCode code="report" /></a></td>
    <td><CopyableCode code="exec" /></td>
    <td><a href="#parameter-serviceName"><code>serviceName</code></a></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>This method provides telemetry reporting for services that are integrated with [Service Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure). It reports a list of operations that have occurred on a service. It must be called after the operations have been executed. For more information, see [Telemetry Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/telemetry-reporting). NOTE: The telemetry reporting has a hard limit of 1000 operations and 1MB per Report call. It is recommended to have no more than 100 operations per call. This method requires the `servicemanagement.services.report` permission on the specified service. For more information, see [Service Control API Access Control](https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/service-control/access-control).</td>
