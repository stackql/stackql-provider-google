A page of the response received from the ListProjects method. A paginated response where more pages are available has `next_page_token` set. This token can be used in a subsequent request to retrieve the next request page. NOTE: A response may contain fewer elements than the request `page_size` and still have a `next_page_token`.

Feeding this value into a new list request with the `page_token` parameter gives the next page of the results.

<TabItem value="get">

Retrieves the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`). The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission for this project.

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="list">

Lists projects that are direct children of the specified folder or organization resource. `list()` provides a strongly consistent view of the projects underneath the specified parent resource. `list()` returns projects sorted based upon the (ascending) lexical ordering of their `display_name`. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the identified parent.

```sql

Search for projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on, and also satisfy the specified query. This method returns projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method.

```sql

<TabItem value="move">

Move a project to another place in your resource hierarchy, under a new resource parent. Returns an operation which can be used to track the process of the project move workflow. Upon success, the `Operation.response` field will be populated with the moved project. The caller must have `resourcemanager.projects.move` permission on the project, on the project's current and proposed new parent. If project has no current parent, or it currently does not have an associated organization resource, you will also need the `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` permission in the project.

<TabItem value="undelete">

Restores the project identified by the specified `name` (for example, `projects/415104041262`). You can only use this method for a project that has a lifecycle state of DELETE_REQUESTED.
